\title{title screening specific for round 1 on sleep and inflammation}
\usage{
titlescreen1(
  path,
  jc.filename,
  jc.sheetnumber,
  pattern,
  recode = F,
  recode.ra = NULL
)
}
\description{
tasks performed:\cr
1.	merge together jc and ra responses\cr
2.	identify and only keep rows with discrepant codes \cr
3.	arrange the discrepant codes by jc 0 vs. ra 1/2; jc 1 vs. ra 0/2; jc 2 vs. ra 0/1\cr
4.	grab raâ€™s name from filename and place as column name\cr
5.	compute summary descriptives:\itemize{
\item a.	total number of 0, 1, 2 by coder
\item b.	total number of discrepancies
\item c.	total number of each combination of discrepancies
}
6.	repeat above steps for each identified ra file\cr
7.	for recode runs, the discrepancy summary and excel file will be based on second-round values only (i.e., only checking discrepancy in the recode file)\cr
}
